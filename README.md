Fortigate Reserved DHCP Manager
======================

This script allows you to easily manage reserved DHCP as well as correlating firewall address objects. This simplified the policy workflow for static devices tied to users.

***NOTE***: There is no input validation or error checking applied yet. Will come shortly.

## Usage

The following details are needed:

  - Device Name
  - IP Address
  - MAC Address

Then pass them to the script like so:

    ./fortigate_reserved_dhcp.py iPod 10.1.1.80 b8:c7:gg:3f:gh:ij

## Example
